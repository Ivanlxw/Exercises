**Stock querying**
This mini-project involves using pandas-datareader to gather data from iex about a specific stock for a time period (determined by you) and plots a time series of the stock pricing. The .py file apparantly can't support plotly commands so the .ipynb file is also uploaded to make use of plotly commands to plot candlestick graphs.
