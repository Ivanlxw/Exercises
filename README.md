# A list of exercises while learning Python
Exercises that I've done while learning python.

## List of Exercises:

### Blackjack

[Blackjack](https://github.com/Ivanlxw/Exercises/tree/master/BlackJack) is a common game that we play using poker cards. 
This code replicated a simplified version of blackjack where there is a player and a dealer. 
The player can choose whether to hit or stand. It won't know one of the dealer's cards.
If the dealer's points is lower than the player's (if it doesn't bust), then it'll keep hitting until it beats the player or bust

### Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, I coded a simple [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Ivanlxw/Exercises/tree/master/TicTacToe) game where both players can choose where they want to place their 'O's and 'X's where the computer can determine if you have won or not. It'll ask for another game afterwords.

## Mega Project List
I found a mega project list and did some exercises from [karan's](https://github.com/karan/Projects) repository. The projects done are as stated:
## Classes
### Bank Account Manager (variation)
Create a class called Account which will be an abstract class for three other classes called CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount and BusinessAccount. Manage credits and debits from these accounts through an ATM style program.

## Machine Learning
### Kaggle
In the [Kaggle]() folder contains exercises involving datasets from kaggle

### Exercises
All simple exercises related to Machine Learning/Deep Learning will be inside here.

## Files
### Sort csv file utility
Reads a file of records, sorts them, and then writes them back to the file. Allow the user to choose various sort style and sorting based on a particular field.

### Finance with Python
Refer to the readme inside this [directory](https://github.com/Ivanlxw/Exercises/tree/master/PythonFinance)
