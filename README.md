# A list of exercises while learning Python
Exercises that I've done while learning python.

## List of Exercises:

### Blackjack

[Blackjack](https://github.com/Ivanlxw/Exercises/tree/master/BlackJack) is a common game that we play using poker cards. 
This code replicated a simplified version of blackjack where there is a player and a dealer. 
The player can choose whether to hit or stand. It won't know one of the dealer's cards.
If the dealer's points is lower than the player's (if it doesn't bust), then it'll keep hitting until it beats the player or bust

### Tic Tac Toe
In this project, I coded a simple [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Ivanlxw/Exercises/tree/master/TicTacToe) game where both players can choose where they want to place their 'O's and 'X's where the computer can determine if you have won or not. It'll ask for another game afterwords.
